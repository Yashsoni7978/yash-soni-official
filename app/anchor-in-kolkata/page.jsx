const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Who is the best anchor for luxury Marwari weddings in Kolkata?",
    a: "Anchor Yash Soni is highly specialized in hosting for the elite business families of East India. With a deep understanding of Marwari rituals and the ability to project massive authority across giant venues like the ITC Royal Bengal, he delivers a flawless, premium experience."
  },
  {
    q: "How do you handle the massive indoor acoustics at venues like ITC Royal Bengal or JW Marriott?",
    a: "Massive pillarless banquets suffer from extreme sound reverberation. A host who just 'yells louder' will create a wall of noise that drives guests outside. I use very specific mic pacing, strategic pausing, and visual crowd control to cut through the echo and force the audience's attention to the stage."
  },
  {
    q: "Can you host corporate tech and FMCG summits in Rajarhat?",
    a: "Yes. Kolkata's corporate belt in Rajarhat requires absolute professional polish. My corporate delivery is 100% unscripted, utilizing flawless English to moderate panels, manage multi-speaker schedules, and execute complex award felicitations without breaking eye contact with the audience."
  },
  {
    q: "Ours is a cross-cultural wedding. Are you fluent in English and Hindi?",
    a: "I am perfectly bilingual. For cross-cultural events spanning Marwari, Bengali, and NRI demographics in Kolkata, I seamlessly code-switch between languages to ensure no segment of the 1,000+ guest list ever feels excluded."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you use scripts during your anchoring?",
    a: "Never. Scripts destroy the connection between an anchor and the audience. Whether I am guiding a deeply traditional ritual at Taj Bengal or hosting a 600-person tech summit, I operate entirely unscripted to maintain total situational control."
  },
  {
    q: "We are concerned about keeping our older guests engaged during the Sangeet.",
    a: "A great Sangeet honors the family first. I ensure the choreographed family performances are introduced with immense respect and tailored, unscripted introductions. Once the family feels validated, I rapidly shift the gear to high-energy, pulling both elders and youth onto the floor."
  },
  {
    q: "When should we secure your availability for a Kolkata event?",
    a: "Because I travel Pan-India and manage heavy volumes during the Rajasthan wedding season, my availability gets locked extremely fast during winter (Oct–Feb). The moment your venue—like the ITC or Taj—is confirmed, please send a WhatsApp inquiry to block the date."

              Kolkata is the seat of some of India’s oldest business wealth. The families here do not tolerate loud, unrefined hosting. A Marwari wedding at a premium Taj or ITC property is a heavily scrutinized social event. The anchor must possess an intrinsic understanding of North Indian rituals, a highly sophisticated bilingual vocabulary, and the sheer vocal power to manage ballrooms containing over a thousand guests.

              Hosting a high-net-worth Marwari wedding in Kolkata means navigating intense traditional expectations within enormous, modern spaces. The ITC Royal Bengal, for example, is architecturally cavernous. An anchor who speaks softly will vanish. An anchor who screams will offend the elders. The solution is commanding, perfectly timed vocal projection and a deeply respectful, unscripted situational awareness.

              For corporate events in Rajarhat, the dynamic flips entirely. Here, the anchor must transition into sharp, executive English, moderating technical panels and felicitations without missing a beat or relying on paper notes. It is a completely different neurological register.
