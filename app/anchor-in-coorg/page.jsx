const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do you handle outdoor weddings in Coorg when the Western Ghats mist and rain roll in?",
    a: "This is the cardinal rule of rainforest hosting. The second the sun sets or mist rolls into the coffee estate, the crowd wants to retreat. I utilize 'Atmospheric Compression'—speeding up the entire timeline aggressively, plunging into the crowd physically, and detonating a massive session before the weather forces guests indoors."
  },
  {
    q: "Our Bangalore guest list is incredibly sophisticated—tech founders and global VPs. Can you match this tone?",
    a: "Completely. Elite properties like Taj and Tamara do not need a loud, shouting 'hype man'. They require an Executive Moderator. I deliberately drop standard, childish 'wedding gimmicks'. I host with formal, razor-sharp, unscripted English that respects the pedigree of the VIPs, perfectly bridging high-level networking with eventual massive celebration."
  },
  {
    q: "The properties here are massive (100+ acres). How do you prevent guests from wandering off to the villas?",
    a: "Sprawling estates are notorious for 'Audience Drift'. In Coorg, guests go wandering for valley views or retreat to their rooms. I play the role of the 'Timeline engine'—deploying rapid-fire, high-frequency pacing that constantly drags the guests back to the main stage, actively preventing the energy from bleeding away."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you use teleprompters or scripts during these complex multi-day Coorg itineraries?",
    a: "Never. Reading from a clipboard instantly kills raw party energy. It breaks your eye contact, and the high-net-worth audience realizes you are not in command. I memorize the family lineages, the corporate tensions, and the full timeline, enabling me to host 100% unscripted and dictate the absolute flow of the room."
  },
  {
    q: "What if the rainforest weather forces us to suddenly move our event from the lawns into the banquets?",
    a: "Western Ghats weather systems are extremely volatile. If rain forces us to move an outdoor setup and compress an sprawling Sangeet into an indoor banquet hall dynamically, I operate with zero panic. Because I am purely unscripted, I instantly recalibrate the pacing, compress the performances on the fly, and reconstruct the hype natively indoors."
  },
  {
    q: "Since you travel nationally, how are your logistics handled for Coorg?",
    a: "Travel to Coorg (via Kannur/Coimbatore Airport or the Bangalore highway) is completely streamlined. I am constantly active across the South India luxury wedding circuit (Bangalore/Chennai/Ooty/Coorg), so there are zero hidden logistical risks. All exact requirements are provided instantly when blocking dates."
  },
  {
    q: "When should we freeze your dates for a Coorg eco-estate event?",
    a: "Coorg’s premium destination windows (especially for Taj and Tamara) vanish over 18 months in advance for big weekends. Lock my dates the instant your luxury venue contract is confirmed."

              Coorg blends absolute rainforest serenity with sprawling, ultra-modern luxury infrastructure. The properties here feature sweeping architecture that scatters massive outdoor soundscapes, and the demographic is decisively weighted towards Bangalore and Mumbai's highest corporate tier. An anchor here cannot just be loud and generic. He must possess razor-sharp cultural intelligence to navigate VIP corporate mechanics, the linguistic polish to match high-end legacy, and the unscripted power to detonate a Sangeet against the aggressively dropping mountain weather.

The moment formal day-networking concludes, the crowd fragments entirely across the resort footprints. Yash assumes the role of the Timeline Architect—using extreme vocal pacing and dominant stage psychology to forcefully pull the Bangalore VIPs into the central phase, instantly generating massive momentum before the mountain drop paralyzes energy.
