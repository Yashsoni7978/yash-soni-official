const TESTIMONIALS = [
  {
    name: "Malhotra Family (Delhi NCR)",
    quote: "Neemrana Fort is spectacular but logistically terrifying. It has 14 different levels, guests are constantly wandering, and they don't allow loud DJs late at night. Yash stepped up and literally kept our entire wedding together using purely his voice and stage presence. When the DJ volume had to drop, Yash’s organic energy carried the Sangeet.",
    event: "Fortress Destination Wedding · Neemrana Fort-Palace"
  },
  {
    name: "Director — FinTech HQ Gurgaon",
    quote: "We brought our entire C-suite out to Neemrana for our annual strategy retreat. Yash anchored the daytime panels with incredible precision, handled Q&A sessions without any notes, and then transitioned into hosting our evening gala flawlessly. True executive hosting.",
    event: "Leadership Offsite · Ramada Neemrana · 120 delegates"
  },
  {
    name: "Singhania Family",
    quote: "Tijara Fort is beautiful, but our guest list was a complex mix of very traditional elders from Rajasthan and our kids' heavily international corporate friends from Delhi. Yash’s bilingual flow was the anchor that made everyone feel like they belonged to the exact same family.",

  },
];

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Properties like Neemrana Fort have strict limits on DJ volume. How do you handle the Sangeet?",
    a: "This is the true test of a heritage anchor. When you cannot rely on 100-decibel subwoofers to blast the crowd into dancing, you have to use psychological momentum. I employ hyper-interactive timeline pacing, verbal hype, and intimate crowd engagement to generate a massive, organic energy spike that doesn't trigger the venue's decibel meters."
  },
  {
    q: "We are hosting a corporate strategy offsite from Gurgaon. Do you use scripts?",
    a: "I never use scripts. For Delhi/NCR executive crowds, reading from paper instantly destroys authority. I memorize the strategy flow, the panelists, and the schedule so I can modulate the panels flawlessly while maintaining continuous eye contact with the CEO and delegates."
  },
  {
    q: "How do you manage the acoustic scatter inside a 14-tiered stepped fortress?",
    a: "Fortresses are acoustic black holes; sound either dissipates totally or echoes chaotically off the stone. Instead of yelling, I use specific 'voice-compression' stage techniques, physically anchoring myself at the most central choke point, using pacing to pull the wandering guests back into the main action frame."
  },
  {
    q: "Can you bridge a highly modern Delhi crowd with deeply traditional Rajasthani relatives?",
    a: "This is precisely what makes Neemrana the perfect weekend destination—and exactly where my bilingual expertise shines. I use rapid code-switching, delivering pristine English to validate the NCR corporate/modern demographic while immediately countering with deeply respectful Hindi to honor the Rajasthani elders."
  },
  {
    q: "Are you familiar with the logistics of Tijara Fort Palace as well?",
    a: "Yes. Both Neemrana Fort and Tijara Fort fall into the same extreme-heritage event category. They require a host who respects the architectural boundaries, operates smoothly within the strict timings, and elevates the prestige of the property rather than trying to turn it into a cheap nightclub."
  },
  {
    q: "A lot of anchors charge heavy logistics from Delhi. Where do you travel from?",
    a: "I frequently bounce across the Delhi-Jaipur highway corridor. Because Neemrana is essentially the midpoint of my primary working territory, my logistics and technical riders are incredibly seamless and cost-effective compared to flying someone in."
  },
  {
    q: "How early should we book you for a Neemrana event?",
    a: "Neemrana's booking season is brutal because corporate 'weekend offsites' directly clash with 'weekend destination weddings'. The properties sell out fast. The exact day you lock your Fort Palace or resort dates, WhatsApp me to freeze the anchoring calendar."

              Neemrana is not an open banquet hall. It is a highly compressed, vertically stacked historic zone catering almost entirely to the powerful Delhi-Gurgaon corridor. An anchor cannot simply 'yell' here—the sound breaks immediately. The event must be controlled through extreme pacing, psychological momentum, and immaculate bilingual English-Hindi bridging that satisfies highly modern corporate professionals while honoring traditional family elders.

              Hosting an event in Neemrana requires an elite understanding of 'Acoustic Compression'. A 14-tier fortress destroys traditional sound systems, and heritage decibel limits prevent DJs from blasting the crowd into compliance. An amateur anchor will fail totally here. The anchor must dictate the timeline aggressively, physically corral wandering guests with stage presence, and manufacture intense Sangeet energy entirely organically.
