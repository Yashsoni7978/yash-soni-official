const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do you handle outdoor weddings in Ooty when the Nilgiri mist and cold roll in at sunset?",
    a: "This is the cardinal rule of high-altitude hosting. The second the sun sets over the tea gardens, the crowd wants to retreat. A basic DJ setup cannot counter this psychology. I utilize 'Temperature Compression'—speeding up the entire timeline aggressively, plunging into the crowd physically, and detonating a massive dancing session before the cold forces families indoors."
  },
  {
    q: "Our Bangalore guest list is incredibly sophisticated—tech founders and corporate VIPs. Can you match this tone?",
    a: "Completely. Elite heritage properties like Savoy do not need a loud, shouting 'hype man'. They require an Executive Moderator. I deliberately drop standard, childish 'wedding gimmicks'. I host with formal, razor-sharp, unscripted English that respects the pedigree of the VIPs, perfectly bridging high-level networking with eventual massive celebration."
  },
  {
    q: "The properties here are heritage sites with strict noise and acoustic rules. How do you adapt?",
    a: "I execute 'Acoustic Precision'. In locations like Coonoor or Ooty, I am extremely mindful of property decibel limits during the Day. I host conversationally. However, when the Sangeet begins, I use 'Crowd Condensing'—physically pulling the guests towards the core stage area to generate massive perceived energy without needing to volume-blast the whole mountain."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you use teleprompters or scripts during these complex multi-day Ooty itineraries?",
    a: "Never. Reading from a clipboard instantly kills raw party energy. It breaks your eye contact, and the high-net-worth audience realizes you are not in command. I memorize the family lineages, the corporate tensions, and the full timeline, enabling me to host 100% unscripted and dictate the absolute flow of the room."
  },
  {
    q: "What if the mountain weather forces us to suddenly move our event from the lawns into the ballrooms?",
    a: "Himalayan and Nilgiri weather systems are volatile. If rain forces us to rip down an outdoor setup and compress an sprawling Sangeet into an indoor banquet hall dynamically, I operate with zero panic. Because I am purely unscripted, I instantly recalibrate the pacing, compress the performances on the fly, and reconstruct the hype natively indoors."
  },
  {
    q: "Since you travel nationally, how are your logistics handled for Ooty?",
    a: "Travel to Ooty (via Coimbatore Airport or the highway) is completely streamlined. I am constantly active across the South India luxury wedding circuit (Bangalore/Chennai/Ooty/Coorg), so there are zero hidden logistical risks. All exact requirements are calculated and provided instantly when blocking dates."
  },
  {
    q: "When should we freeze your dates for a Nilgiri heritage event?",
    a: "Ooty’s premium destination windows (especially for Savoy and Ferrnhills) vanish over 12 months in advance for big weekends. Lock my dates the instant your luxury venue contract is confirmed."

You are dealing with literal historical monuments like Savoy (IHCL) where <strong className="text-[#D4AF37]">colonial architecture and Bangalore’s highest tech-elite demographics</strong> requires flawless execution. Yash steps into these sprawling, heritage mountain architectures and manufactures incredibly tight, explosive dancing energy entirely organically, pulling the VIPs together before the altitude drops the temperature.

              Ooty blends absolute Victorian colonial serenity with sprawling, ultra-modern luxury infrastructure. The properties here feature heritage Victorian architectures that scatter massive outdoor soundscapes, and the demographic is decisively weighted towards Bangalore and Mumbai's highest corporate tier. An anchor here cannot just be loud and generic. He must possess razor-sharp cultural intelligence to navigate VIP corporate mechanics, the linguistic polish to match high-end heritage, and the unscripted power to detonate a Sangeet against the aggressively dropping mountain weather.
