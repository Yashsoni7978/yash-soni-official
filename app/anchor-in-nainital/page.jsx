const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do you handle outdoor functions by Naini Lake where the altitude drops the temperature drastically?",
    a: "This is the true test of a Kumaon destination anchor. When the evening cold hits the lake, guests instantly mentally check out and want to go inside. A generic DJ set will fail here. I use 'Psychological Momentum'—accelerating the timeline aggressively, physically moving into the crowd, and forcing an explosive dancing state via unscripted interaction before the cold ruins the event."
  },
  {
    q: "We are holding our Varmala outdoors. The wind off the lake is usually very loud. Can you manage the audio spread?",
    a: "The acoustic drop-off at properties in Bhimtal and Nainital is massive. I actively deploy 'Acoustic Defense'. Instead of just telling the DJ to max the volume (which causes terrible echo), I restructure the crowd physically—pulling the seating tighter to the stage—and I use heavy vocal projection to overpower the ambient wind, ensuring the emotional depth of the Pheras is deeply felt."
  },
  {
    q: "Our guest list is highly exclusive—mostly South Delhi executives and VIP corporate legacy families. Can you match this tone?",
    a: "Completely. A VIP destination wedding at The Naini Retreat does not need a high-pitched 'hype man'; it requires an Executive Moderator. I drop all standard 'wedding gimmick' games. I host with sharp, highly conversational, unscripted English that treats the VIPs with intellectual respect, bridging the gap between networking and raw celebration."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you use teleprompters or scripts during these complex multi-day lakeside itineraries?",
    a: "Never. Scripts destroy raw party energy. When you read from a clipboard, you look unprepared and you completely break eye contact with a high-net-worth audience. I memorize the family lineages, the corporate dynamics, and the overarching timeline. This allows me to host 100% unscripted to maintain absolute command over the sprawling property."
  },
  {
    q: "What if sudden mountain rain systems force us to spontaneously move our open-air Sangeet indoors?",
    a: "High-altitude logistics are inherently volatile. If extreme weather forces us to compress an sprawling outdoor Sangeet into an indoor banquet hall dynamically, I do not panic. Because I am entirely unscripted, I instantly synthesize the new pacing, stitch family performances together on the fly, and reconstruct the Sangeet hype natively."
  },
  {
    q: "Since you travel nationally, how are your logistics handled for Nainital/Bhimtal?",
    a: "Logistics to the Kumaon region (via Pantnagar Airport or the Kathgodam highway) are highly streamlined. I operate heavily across the Delhi-NCR/Uttarakhand corridor, so there are no massive travel delays. The exact logistical rider is verified and provided instantly upon booking."
  },
  {
    q: "When should we freeze your dates for a Kumaon event?",
    a: "Nainital’s destination season aligns directly with the absolute peak luxury resort dates. Elite properties vanish over a year in advance for high-net-worth weddings. Lock my dates the exact moment your luxury venue contract is signed."

              Nainital and Bhimtal combine profound mountain heritage with massive, ultra-modern luxury lake infrastructure. The properties here feature sweeping waterfront views that entirely scatter outdoor audio, and the demographic is decisively weighted towards Delhi NCR's highest corporate tier wanting a pristine escape. Yash masters this—possessing razor-sharp cultural intelligence to navigate VIP corporate mechanics, the linguistic polish to match high-end heritage lineage, and the unscripted explosive power to ignite a Sangeet against the dropping mountain weather.
