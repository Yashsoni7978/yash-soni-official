      ### The Pink City Grandeur
      Planning a wedding in Jaipur is a historical production. Whether it is the sheer scale of The Fairmont or the intimate royalty of Rambagh Palace, your choice dictates the logistics.

      ### Choosing Your Venue
      Fairmont is built for massive, high-energy sangeets with 1000+ guests. The gardens of Jai Mahal, however, are perfect for traditional pheras under the stars. 

      ### The Anchor's Role
      A palace wedding requires a voice that can command a massive ballroom without sounding like a club DJ. It requires royalty, wit, and seamless crowd control.

      ### The Anatomy of a Gala
      Corporate galas are high-stakes. You have CEOs, stakeholders, and top performers in one room. If the energy drops, the event fails.

      ### The Run of Show
      The secret to a flawless gala is the 'Run of Show' document. Every minute must be accounted for. When the CEO walks on stage, the walk-up track needs to hit the crescendo exactly as they reach the mic.

      ### The Marathon of Indian Weddings
      Hosting a 3-day Indian wedding is an extreme sport. You are managing the Haldi at 10 AM, the Sangeet at 9 PM, and the Pheras at 2 AM. 

      ### Voice Preservation
      The biggest mistake amateur anchors make is blowing their voice out on night one. You have to speak from the diaphragm, stay hydrated with warm water, and know when to let the DJ take over the crowd's energy.

      ### The Fine Line of Roasting
      A Sangeet needs humor, but it must never be disrespectful. The trick is to interview the bride and groom beforehand to get the "inside jokes" of the family.

      ### Scripting the Transitions
      The script isn't just jokes; it's transitions. How do you get from a highly emotional father-daughter dance to a high-energy cousins' hip-hop routine? The anchor is the bridge.

      ### The Airport Strategy
      The guest experience starts at the airport, not the hotel. Having dedicated hospitality desks at the arrival terminal sets the luxury tone immediately.

      ### Shadow Teams
      For large destination weddings, we deploy "shadow teams." While the guests are enjoying the Mehendi, the shadow team is already at the Sangeet venue doing the final sound checks and lighting rehearsals.
